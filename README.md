# Sales & Subscription Performance Dashboard

A two-page Power BI dashboard that uncovers what’s really driving revenue: sales commission mechanics and subscription retention.

---

## Overview

- **Sales Incentives Unpacked**: See not just how many deals were won, but how commission is earned — across base pay, attainment bonuses, ARPU bonuses, and clawbacks.  
- **Subscription Health Revealed**: Track new sign-ups vs churn; measure early cancellation rates; understand customer tenure and recurring revenue sustainability.

---

## What You’ll See

- Performance by rep and region: commission, attainment, product mix.  
- Monthly trends in net subscriber growth (new minus canceled subscriptions).  
- An MRR walk (waterfall) showing how revenue moves month by month.  
- Cohort retention comparisons (2023 vs 2024).  
- Early cancellation and clawback impact — not hidden, but analyzed.

---

## Why It Matters

This dashboard puts substance behind surface numbers. It helps leadership:

- Identify which incentive levers are working (or not).  
- Spot retention risks early on, before revenue erodes.  
- Allocate coaching & resources based on where real churn is happening.  
- Forecast revenue growth with more confidence.

---

## How It Works

- Key metrics are calculated using DAX with consistent “range” or “as-of” logic — whether you’re looking at one month or multiple months.  
- Early cancels and clawbacks use defined windows (≤3 months) tied to subscription start dates.  
- Totals are weighted correctly, so “grand total” revenue, churn, and clawbacks reconcile with the sum of monthly breakdowns.

---

## Considerations & Next Steps

- The three-month early cancel rule is fixed; real-world businesses may use different thresholds.  
- Values are monthly aggregates; partial months are treated in full month buckets (no pro-ration).  
- Addition of product- or segment-level breakdowns would provide deeper insight.
